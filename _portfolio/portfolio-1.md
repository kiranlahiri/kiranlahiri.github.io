FinCanon is a full-stack web application that analyzes investment portfolios using advanced financial metrics including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, rolling performance, and efficient frontier detection. The tool integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by 10 seminal finance papers (Markowitz, Sharpe, Fama-French, Black-Scholes, etc.) to provide portfolio-aware insights grounded in academic research. Built with React, FastAPI, LangChain, and Qdrant vector database, the application is deployed on Vercel and Railway with real-time data visualization and personalized investment analysis.
