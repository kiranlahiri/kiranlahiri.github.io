I recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a BS in Computer Science, where I took an interest in computer architecture and embedded systems. My favorite projects include:  
- implementing a MIPS-R10000 style out-of-order processor in SystemVerilog alongside 4 teammates.
- working on a C++ battery simulator used to select the most efficient battery cell out of a group of candidates for the Michigan Solar Car Team.
- designing an "Automated Glockenspiel" alongside 2 teammates; this was a xylophone like instrument that played more than a dozen songs, implemented using an STM32, linear solenoid, and LCD display

I'm eager to find projects and roles where I can use programming skills in the areas of design verification, GPU programming, and embedded systems. I am currently searching for software engineering roles that fit my interests and experiences. Please contact at lahirik@umich.edu.

SKILLS: C/C++, Python, Verilog/SystemVerilog, JavaScript, SQL, MATLAB, HTML, CSS 

Professional Experience
======

- Cantor Fitzgerald - June 2024 to August 2024 - Technology Intern
- Lynred-USA - May 2023 to August 2023 - Engineering Assistant
- Mathnasium - June 2021 to August 2021 - Math Tutor

Miscellaneous
======

- I am currently trying my hand at learning CUDA. EECS470 at Michigan sparked my interest in computer architecture and hardware description languages. Learning GPU programming enables me to apply my programming skills in the area of computer architecture, which excites me very much. 

- While at Michigan, I contributed to research in a neuroscience lab studying the mammalian auditory system. In this role, I curated  neuronal imagng data contianing images of the inferior colliculus of mice collected from behavioral experiments.

- In my free time, I enjoy playing music, watching sports, and reading novels. I played the Alto Saxophone on the Michigan Basketball Band this past season which was lots of fun! To keep up my interest in reading and writing, I briefly wrote news pieces for the Michigan Daily as a Staff Reporter. Nowadays, I just read books.
